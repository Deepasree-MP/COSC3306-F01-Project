# COSC3306 Final Course Project  
### Interactive 3D Architecture Environment (Three.js)

---

## Project Overview
This project is about creating an **interactive 3D architectural environment** using **Three.js**.  
The goal is to apply what I’ve learned about:
- 3D modeling and scene setup  
- Using different materials and lights  
- Adding animation and camera movement  

The final output is a small **virtual home** or **apartment** with at least **two rooms** that users can explore interactively.

---

## 1. Structure of the Environment

### Requirements
- Design a **complete structure** with **two separate rooms**.  
- Each room should include:
  - Walls with some thickness  
  - A floor and ceiling  
  - A doorway or opening that connects to the other room  

### Design Notes
- Use simple **geometric shapes** like boxes and planes to build the rooms.  
- Make sure everything looks **proportional and realistic**.  
- Keep the layout easy to navigate.

---

## 2. Room Details and Furnishings

Each room should look like a real space with:
- **3 to 5 furniture items** or decorative objects (for example, a bed, sofa, table, chair, or lamp).  
- Proper **scaling and positioning** of each object.  
- At least **three types of materials** (for example, wood for a table, glass for a window, metal for a lamp).  

Try to make the rooms feel balanced and visually appealing.

---

## 3. Camera Navigation

### Core Features
- Allow users to **move around the scene** and explore both rooms.  
- Use:
  - `OrbitControls` for mouse-based movement, or  
  - Your own simple movement system using the keyboard or mouse.  

### Bonus Features (Optional)
- Smooth camera transitions between rooms.  
- Collision detection so the camera doesn’t move through walls.

## 4. Animation

Add some simple animation to make the scene more lively.  
Examples include:
- A **rotating ceiling fan**  
- A **swinging door**  
- Any small motion that makes the space feel realistic  

---

## 5. What to Submit

You will submit:
1. **Runnable source code** – HTML, JavaScript, and any related files.  
2. A **short written report (3–5 pages)** that includes:
   - How to run your project.  
   - A short description of your main features.  
   - A list of any textures, libraries, or assets you used.  
   - Any known bugs or missing features.  
   - Screenshots or a short video showing different camera angles.  

---

## 6. Group or Individual Work

You can work **alone or in a group** (up to 5 members).  

- **Group Project:**
  - With a **peer evaluation form** → ✅ 15 points (full marks)  
  - Without peer form → ⚠️ 7 points only  
- **Individual Project:** 3 points  

---

## AI-Generated Content Policy

AI tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot can be used **for assistance**, but:
- The work must be **your own** and **substantially edited** by you.  
- If your project is found to be **100% AI-generated**, up to **10 points may be deducted**.  
- Always **mention any AI help** you used in your comments or report.

## 7. Grading Rubric (100 Points → 35% of Final Grade)

| **Category** | **Points** | **Excellent** | **Good** | **Fair** | **Poor** |
|---------------|------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **3D Scene Design & Implementation** | 35 | 32–35 pts — Two or more complete rooms with realistic materials and details. | 26–31 pts — Mostly correct; small issues with geometry or textures. | 18–25 pts — Basic structure; few decorations or repeated materials. | 0–17 pts — Incomplete or missing architecture. |
| **Interactivity, Animation & Lighting** | 25 | 23–25 pts — Smooth camera, realistic lighting, and one or more animations. | 19–22 pts — Works well but could be smoother. | 14–18 pts — Some lighting or animation, but limited. | 0–13 pts — No interactivity or animation. |
| **Code, Report & Submission Quality** | 25 | 14–15 pts — Well-written code, organized files, clear report with visuals. | 11–13 pts — Mostly organized and complete. | 4–10 pts — Missing one part (like report or screenshots). | 0–3 pts — Incomplete submission. |
| **Group or Individual Work** | 15 | Group (with peer form): 15 pts | Group (no form): 7 pts | Individual: 3 pts | — |

## Tips for Success

- Write **clean and well-commented code**.  
- Check that camera controls and lighting work correctly.  
- Use simple shapes and textures to keep performance smooth.  
- Experiment with **ambient**, **point**, and **directional lights** for depth.  
- Use shadows carefully for a realistic look.  
- Keep your files well-organized before submission.
